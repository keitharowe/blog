# Background
I work at Aztek, a small web development and digital marketing company. We have a flexible work/team environnement, here are some tips that may (or may not) help you to have an enjoyable, work free, vacation.

Summer is coming, great time to take time off, scared about the ramifications of taking time off? Don't be! None of this article is new or groundbreaking; most of it is common sense. However, like most things in life, or SEO its not one thing to make a huge shift, its the 100 little things.

## You are not that important
Let go, trust your team, they are strong and have your back. They can survive for a week, or two, or maybe even longer while you are gone. Not sure if you have a capable team? Try it. Tried it and it didn't work as your cell phone was ringing constantly? Sounds like there might be some other deeper issues to solve first. 

## The universe punishes me taking PTO
I've heard too often that people get punished when they take time off or return from PTO with a ton more work and a mountain of emails, and wish they didn't take time off at all. Wow, really?! True, that emails will pile up while you are out, however, there are some good Outlook hygiene rules that I use (another post), and some extra effort work that needs to be done to prepare for your time off.

## Tips

### Get your work in order
Get your work in order, don't leave 10 open things and don't respond to 10 open things the afternoon before you leave. Can't close the loop on all your items, a simple communication to your team or client that it will get addressed when you return. It may be a bit hard to face the fact that this thing will not get done until X weeks, however, set the proper expectation with your audience. 

### 7Ps - Prior Proper Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance
I had a miliary friend who introduced me to this acronym and it stuck with me over the years. This sounds dumb to even mention this, but plan your PTO in advance, not the week before, but as far out as possible, three or four weeks minimum, or longer if possible. At Aztek we have monthly planning meetings, in addition to weekly planning meetings, plan for it then, schedule the upcoming work so that you are not starting a new project the week before, or completing a project the week before and/or have someone cover for you if you cannot control these things. There are numerous other situations but the basic point is to plan far in advance and include your team.

### Phone
- Disable email on your [phone](https://www.dummies.com/consumer-electronics/smartphones/iphone/how-to-temporarily-disable-an-email-account-on-your-iphone/)
- [Turn off calendar notifications](https://www.wikihow.com/Turn-Off-Calendar-Notifications-on-an-iPhone) as no one wants to get a push notification about some upcoming meeting about some topic that you dread
- Disable, Slack, Jira, Confluence, other work app notifications

Why? The idea is to unplug and not even accidentally occupy your precious zen like recharge state with new work items

### Email Signature
Super simple, add a small link to your email signature (way in advance, remember, planning!) that you will be on PTO from X to Y. Don't forget to set a calendar reminder to remove it when you return. It's small, most may not notice, but some might and it helps get the word out that you take PTO seriously and are doing your very best to keep everyone informed.
